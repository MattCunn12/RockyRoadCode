# RockyRoadCode
Code for **Rocky Road Customer Support System**, a customer service portal that aims to enhance customer interaction and provide efficient support mechanisms.  
The portal will feature:
1. A live chat function for real-time communication with customer service representatives.
2. An AI-driven chatbot to handle routine queries.
3. An FAQ section to provide quick access to common questions.
4. A community forum where users can engage in discussions, share solutions, and seek advice from peers.  

We are developing this project using HTML with Bootstrap, Python, and MySQL hosted in a Docker container.
